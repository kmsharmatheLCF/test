          Applicant authorizes Utah Business Loans and its assigns, agents,
          banks or financial institutions to obtain an investigative or consumer
          report from a credit bureau or a credit agency and to investigate the
          references given on any other statement or data obtained from
          applicant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual terms for which your business may qualify will depend on
          various things about your business and you, including industry type,
          time in business, verified revenue, credit history, and business
          report information, among other things. Such factors or others may
          cause the terms for which your business qualifies, if any, to be
          different than the information presented by an agent. By moving
          forward, you acknowledge that you’re asking us to determine how much
          you qualify for, rather than requesting a certain business capital
          amount. The information shown on our properties or by our staff does
          not constitute an offer or commitment by lending organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sole purpose of the information we request is for verification of
          eligibility, criminal background and fraudulent activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
          record information that identifies each person who opens an account.
          What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for
          your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will
          allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license
          or other identifying documents.
