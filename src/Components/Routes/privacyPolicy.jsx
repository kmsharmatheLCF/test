          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from
            children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
            Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency,
            enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
            and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
            online.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years

          <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
            with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In
            order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
            following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </p>
          <p>We will notify you via email</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
            that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
            enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
